## How the Software Addresses the Current Needs of the Business
The real-time translator is designed to facilitate instant translation of text copied to the clipboard, displaying the translation in a pop-up window. This tool is useful for professionals who need to quickly translate snippets of text without switching between windows or applications.

#### Suggested Improvements:
- **Expand language support**: The translator currently supports a limited number of languages. Expanding the list of supported languages would better serve the needs of users.

- **Cloud integration**: The software could integrate with cloud-based APIs like Google Translate or DeepL for more accurate translations and to scale more efficiently.

- **Translation history**: Implement a feature to store the history of translations, which would be useful for frequent users.

## How Systems and Data Interact
The software interacts with the operating system using the clipboard and creating a pop-up window. There are two main levels of interaction:

- **Clipboard text capture**: The program uses a library like pyperclip to capture text copied to the clipboard.
- **Translation**: The captured text is sent to a translation service, like Google Translate, via an API. The translated text is received and displayed in a pop-up window using a library like tkinter.

#### Suggestions for Improving Interoperability:
- **Support for more input formats**: Currently, the program only takes text from the clipboard. It would be beneficial to allow translations from text files or even images containing text (OCR).
- **Support for Other Translation APIs**: Enhance interoperability by enabling the app to connect to additional translation services (Microsoft Translator).
- **Optimization for Slow Connections**: Implement an option to cache frequently translated texts, so the system does not always rely on an internet connection to translate previously translated content.

## Required Skills to Develop and Maintain the Software:
To develop and maintain this project, specific skills are required in various areas:
- Technical Skills:
    -  **Python**: knowledge of Python, including working with libraries like pyperclip, tkinter, and translation APIs.
    - **GUI Development**: Experience with libraries like tkinter to create simple yet effective user interfaces.

#### Strategies for Training Future Contributors:
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensure the code is well-commented, with clear guides on setting up the development environment, contributing to the project, and testing the software.
- **API and Clipboard Handling Training**: Provide tutorials or courses on how to work with APIs and interact with the operating system for clipboard management.
